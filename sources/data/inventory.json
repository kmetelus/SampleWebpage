        "description": "The 2016 J-15 features the same round-shoulder body shape of Gibson's J-45, aka 'The Workhorse', an incredibly popular acoustic that has been one of Gibson's best-selling guitars since it's introduction in 1942. With it's electronics and high-quality body construction, the 2016 J-15 can easily become your new workhorse as it can handle the demands of both intimate settings and larger venues.\n Handcrafted exclusively at Gibson's Bozeman, Montana facility, this J-15 is all about North American sustainable tonewoods, with a Sitka spruce top which provides you with ample velocity, and sustainable American walnut back and sides which possesses some of the warmth of rosewood while adding a dash of mahogany's presence, all without the extra weight. This 24.75 in. scale acoustic-electric also features a neck-to-body dovetail joint secured with hide glue to ensure the resonance transfer from strings to body stays at a premium level throughout the life of the guitar. \n The 2016 J-15's radiused body with scalloped X-bracing provides the kind of projection and clarity that you expect in a more expensive model. The hand-sprayed nitrocellulose lacquer finish not only lets the tone of the J-15 to mature with age, but also allows the unique character and beauty of the guitar's woods to shine through. When it's time to plug in, the 2016 J-15 will spoil your amp and ears even more thanks to L.R. Baggs Element electronics. Unlike typical undersaddle acoustic guitar pickups that are dependent on string compression for their sound, the Element was engineered to mirror the soundboard's actual movement as you play. At the heart of the pickup, a flexible film sensor only .002 thick picks up the guitar's most delicate nuances. Tracking the motion of the top rather than a direct string attack suppresses 'quack' caused by compression and unlocks the Element's unrivaled dynamic range. The pickup's minimalist construction lessens any influence on the acoustic properties and creates an intimate coupling between the pickup and guitar for the highest fidelity possible.",
